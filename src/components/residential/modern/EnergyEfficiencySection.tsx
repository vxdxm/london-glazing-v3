        Energy efficiency is essential in all buildings, but it takes on heightened importance in older structures due to their often inefficient original building methods and materials. 
        Inadequate insulation and air leakage can lead to excessive heating and cooling costs, which can be detrimental to both the environment and the economic feasibility of maintaining these buildings.

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Furthermore, retrofitting historic buildings with modern energy-efficient systems can enhance their long-term viability and sustainability.
