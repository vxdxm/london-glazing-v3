      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        In an increasingly environmentally-conscious world, reducing one's carbon footprint is a key consideration for many homeowners. Secondary glazing plays a vital role in this by decreasing energy consumption, which in turn reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with heating and cooling systems.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
        The installation of secondary glazing contributes to a more sustainable living environment by improving energy efficiency. As homes consume less energy, the demand for fossil fuels decreases, leading to a reduction in overall carbon emissions. This is particularly important as communities globally strive to meet environmental targets and objectives aimed at combating climate change.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Contribution to Sustainable Living</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
        Secondary glazing not only supports individual homeowners in their energy-saving efforts but also contributes to broader sustainability goals within communities. By enhancing energy efficiency in residential buildings, secondary glazing helps reduce overall energy demand, which can lead to lower energy prices and reduced strain on local power grids.
