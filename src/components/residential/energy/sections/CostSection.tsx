      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        When considering secondary glazing, homeowners often weigh the initial costs against potential long-term savings. The upfront cost of secondary glazing installation can vary widely based on the type of system chosen and the complexity of the installation. However, many studies have shown that the energy savings achieved through secondary glazing can lead to a return on investment within a few years.

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
        Over time, the cumulative savings on energy bills can be substantial. For example, a property that spends $2,000 annually on heating might save up to 30% after installing secondary glazing, resulting in savings of $600 per year. This not only offsets the initial installation costs but also enhances the long-term financial viability of the property.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Financial Incentives and Rebates</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
        Many governments and energy companies offer financial incentives and rebates for homeowners who invest in energy-efficient solutions such as secondary glazing. These programs can significantly reduce the initial costs associated with installation. Homeowners should research local and national programs, as these incentives can make secondary glazing an even more appealing financial decision.
