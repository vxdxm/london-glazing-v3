      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How Secondary Glazing Reduces Noise</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Another substantial advantage of secondary glazing is its ability to significantly reduce external noise. The air gap created by the two layers of glazing acts as an effective sound barrier, reducing noise pollution from outside sources such as traffic, construction, or urban environments. This is especially beneficial for homes located in busy areas.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
        Studies have shown that secondary glazing can reduce noise levels by up to 80%, creating a more serene indoor environment. This improvement in sound insulation enhances the quality of life for residents, making homes more comfortable and conducive to relaxation and productivity.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Case Studies and Evidence</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Numerous case studies highlight the effectiveness of secondary glazing in noise reduction. For example, a residential building in London installed secondary glazing in its units facing a major road. Residents reported a marked decrease in noise disturbances, leading to better sleep quality and overall satisfaction with their living conditions.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
        Another study conducted in urban settings indicated that properties with secondary glazing experienced a profound improvement in acoustical comfort, which not only enhanced the living experience but also increased property values due to the appealing quietness.
