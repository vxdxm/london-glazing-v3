      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        One of the primary benefits of secondary glazing is its ability to significantly reduce energy consumption. By creating an additional barrier against heat transfer, secondary glazing can prevent heat loss during winter months and keep homes cooler in the summer. This results in a reduced reliance on heating and cooling systems, leading to lower energy bills.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
        Studies indicate that secondary glazing can improve a window's thermal performance by up to 60%. For homeowners, this can translate into substantial annual savings. With rising energy costs, the financial implications of such savings are increasingly relevant, making secondary glazing a wise investment for long-term energy efficiency.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Secondary Glazing Impact on Energy Efficiency on a Property</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        The overall impact of secondary glazing extends beyond individual energy savings. When implemented across multiple windows in a property, the cumulative effect can lead to a significant reduction in the home's carbon footprint. This is particularly beneficial in urban areas where energy consumption is high.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
        Furthermore, secondary glazing can improve the overall value of a home. Potential buyers are increasingly seeking energy-efficient properties, and having secondary glazing installed can serve as a selling point, particularly in regions where energy efficiency ratings are a focus.
