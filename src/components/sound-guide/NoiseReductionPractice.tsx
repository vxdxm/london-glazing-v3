        When we specify a noise reduction of 45 dB for our premium acoustic glazing solutions, here's what that means in practice:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>A busy road with 85 dB traffic noise would be reduced to approximately 40 dB inside - quieter than a library</li>
        <li>A passing train at 100 dB would be reduced to about 55 dB - barely louder than a normal conversation</li>
        <li>Aircraft noise at 110 dB would be brought down to around 65 dB - noticeable but not disruptive</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        The human perception of sound is subjective, but as a rule of thumb, a 10 dB reduction feels like a halving of loudness. 
        This means that our 45 dB reduction solutions can make even the noisiest environments feel dramatically quieter.
