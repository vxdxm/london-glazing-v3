          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6 text-foreground">Understanding Victorian Sash Windows in Islington</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            Islington's Victorian terraces, built predominantly between 1840-1900, feature the iconic sliding sash windows that define the area's architectural character. These original windows, while beautiful, present modern homeowners with significant challenges: single glazing offers minimal thermal insulation, gaps around frames create persistent draughts, and the thin glass provides little protection against urban noise.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 text-muted-foreground">
            Our secondary glazing solutions are specifically designed for Victorian properties, maintaining the authentic appearance while delivering contemporary performance. We understand that in Islington's conservation areas, any modifications must be sympathetic to the original architecture.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6 text-foreground">Common Challenges in Victorian Terraces</h2>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Thermal Inefficiency</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Single-glazed sash windows can have U-values as high as 5.8 W/m²K, compared to modern standards of 1.4 W/m²K or lower. This results in significant heat loss and high energy bills.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Draught Problems</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Victorian window mechanisms naturally develop gaps over time. These draughts make rooms uncomfortable and force heating systems to work harder.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Noise Infiltration</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Islington's busy streets generate constant noise from traffic, buses, and pedestrians. Single glazing provides minimal acoustic protection.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Condensation Issues</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Cold glass surfaces in Victorian properties often develop condensation, leading to potential mould growth and damage to window frames and surrounding areas.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Sympathetic Sash Window Secondary Glazing</h3>
          <p className="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            Our vertical sliding secondary glazing systems perfectly complement original sash windows. The secondary panels slide independently, allowing you to operate both the original window and secondary glazing as needed. This maintains the authentic functionality while providing modern performance.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Conservation-Approved Design</h3>
          <p className="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            In Islington's conservation areas, we ensure our installations meet strict planning requirements. Our secondary glazing is fitted from the interior, requires no external alterations, and uses slim profiles that maintain the window's proportions when viewed from the street.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Performance Improvements</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-muted-foreground">
            <li>Thermal efficiency: Reduce U-values from 5.8 to 1.8 W/m²K or lower</li>
            <li>Noise reduction: Achieve up to 80% reduction in external noise</li>
            <li>Draught elimination: Create an effective air seal while preserving window operation</li>
            <li>Condensation control: Warmer inner glass surface reduces condensation risk</li>
            <li>Security enhancement: Additional barrier against break-ins</li>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Planning and Conservation Considerations</h3>
          <p className="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            Most secondary glazing installations in Islington's conservation areas don't require planning permission as they're internal modifications. However, we advise checking with Islington Council for listed buildings or properties in particularly sensitive conservation zones.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Minimal Disruption Installation</h3>
          <p className="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            Our installation process is designed to minimize disruption to your daily life. Most Victorian terrace installations can be completed in 1-2 days, depending on the number of windows. We protect your period features and furnishings throughout the process.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Maintaining Period Character</h3>
          <p className="mb-8 text-muted-foreground">
            Our secondary glazing systems are designed to be virtually invisible from the exterior, preserving the street scene that makes Islington's Victorian terraces so desirable. From inside, the slim profiles complement rather than dominate the window space.
          </p>
