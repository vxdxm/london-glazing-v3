  aiConfig.commonQuestions = [
    {
      question: 'How much noise does secondary glazing block?',
      answer: 'Secondary glazing can reduce noise levels by 70-80%, which translates to a reduction of 45-50 decibels. The exact reduction depends on the air gap size, glass type, and installation quality.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the best glass for noise reduction?',
      answer: 'Laminated acoustic glass (6.4mm or 6.8mm) provides the best noise reduction. Using different glass thicknesses in the primary and secondary glazing prevents resonance and blocks a wider range of frequencies.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the air gap affect noise reduction?',
      answer: 'A larger air gap (100-150mm) provides significantly better noise reduction than smaller gaps. The air cavity acts as an acoustic buffer, with larger gaps being more effective at blocking low-frequency noise like traffic rumble.'
